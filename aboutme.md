### My story

It all began in the 80s, when my father brought home a Spectrum 48K.

I still remember the sound. Some games took up to 20 minutes to loadâ€”the anticipation built while we waited, and the successful loading was never guaranteed.

From computer games to creative code, it took more than 15 years to happen. I went to university to pursue a degree in mathematics. Only to discover that I would choose computer programming as my profession. To be honest, the curiosity of how games where made was ever there.

I started playing with ActionScript, and the ease of creating interactions and small games struck me.

Looking back into the memory lane, I landed a full-time Flash Developer job and a part-time gig as a trainer. After a while, I became acquainted with bigger stages when I started receiving regular invitations from Microsoft and Adobe to be a keynote speaker.

Professionaly, I kept going after bigger challenges. Ultimately, more than two decades after, I'm managing and leading development teams.

It has been quite a ride, to be honest.

I hope to share with you all some of my enthusiasm about Creative Coding.
