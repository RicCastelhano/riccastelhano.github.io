### My story

It all began in the 80s, when my father brought home a Spectrum 48K.

I still remember the command line to load games. Ohh and the so characteristic sound. Some games took up to 20 minutes to load. The anticipation skyrocketed while we waited. And it was not 100% guaranteed that the game would load successfully.

I went to university to pursue a degree in mathematics. Only to discover that I would choose computer programming as my profession. To be honest, the curiosity of how games where made was ever there.

But the jump from computer games to creative coding took more than 15 years to happen. 

I started playing with ActionScript, and the ease of creating interactions and small games struck me. Small games, physical interactions, and incredible installations were really simple to attain.

Looking back into the memory lane, it allowed me to land a full-time job as Flash Developer and a part-time gig as an instructor. After a while, I became acquainted with bigger stages when I started receiving regular invitations from Microsoft and Adobe to be a keynote speaker.

Professionally, I kept going after more significant challenges. That approach took me from a frontend developer to a backend developer to a team leader, a Manager, and a CTO.

More than two decades later, I'm managing a Tech Hub in the big "Streaming Wars".

It has been quite a ride, to be honest.

In a full circle, I hope to share with you all some of my enthusiasm for creative coding.
