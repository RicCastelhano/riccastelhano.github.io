Hi, my name is Ricardo Castelhano.

TL;DR:
- Senior Engineering Manager at SKY building Peacock, SkyShowtime, Showmax
- Forever learner of Leadership
- Seasoned Keynote Speaker
- Former College Lecturer
- Still daydreams about creative coding




All of my professional career is connected to software development and teaching. 

And it all started with Creative Coding. The fascination of all the cool animations, interactions, installations, games that people could create using a programming language.

That took me to land a fulltime job as a Software Developer. It happened more than two decades ago.

Currently I'm leading several teams building Peacock, SkyShowtime and Showmax applications for BigScreen TVs.


### My story

It all began in the 80s, when my father brought home a Spectrum 48K. I still remember the sound of the games loading, after we press the command `load ""`.

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29) and it will answer **all** your questions.




Currently I’m working as Senior Engineer Manager in the Global Streaming Platform at Sky in Portugal. I’m responsible for the leadership, mentorship, engineering excellence and growth of several frontend development teams for Big Screen devices. We are building Peacock and SkyShowtime streaming services.

As a seasoned keynote speaker, I have experience in national and international events organised by companies like Microsoft and Adobe. I never miss an opportunity to jump on stage and share some love.

I have been working to learn more about myself and how stress and anxiety impact me personally and professionally.

I have Don Miguel Ruiz’s four agreements as my North Star:
– Be Impeccable With Your Word;
– Don’t Take Anything Personally;
– Don’t Make Assumptions;
– Always Do Your Best.

Welcome to this space, where I will share my leadership insights and everything I know about stress and anxiety management. Feel free to contact me if I can be of service.
