Two years before I was born, **Atari, Inc.** developed and published an arcade videogame called *Breakout*.

My dad was a computer programmer back in the days when computers were big enough to fill up an entire living room. And some years after my birth, I do remember that my dad brought home our first computer - a magical *Sinclair ZX Spectrum 48K*.

I was a kid somewhere between the ages of 6 and 8. And it was magical to have access to a computer so small yet so "powerful" that allowed us to play all those great games (don't judge; in my kid's mind, it was magical indeed).

Since my dad's passing, I'm recalling more and more late memories.

In 1987, **Imagine Software Ltd** released a new version of that game, specifically for Spectrum computers - it was called *Arkanoid*

And I did spend hours playing this game with my dad.

In a good hommage to those days, I created a short tutorial on how to build a similar game.

If you go through the code (and all the comments), you will know how the *Breakout/Arkanoid* game works by the end.

Here is the [Breakout Game Tutorial GitHub Repo](https://github.com/RicCastelhano/breakout-game-tutorial).

Enjoy,
