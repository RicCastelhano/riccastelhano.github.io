There are several ways to build a game world. I created a simple project, a sort of beginners' tutorial, where I focus the attention to a technique called `TileBased`. In summary it will allow us to use `tiles` to generate all the game maps we need.

If you go through the code, by the end of it, you will have an idea of how to create maps similar to this one:

I'm using free tiles from [GameArt2D](https://www.gameart2d.com/freebies.html), and you can download the entire tileset **Graveyard Platformer Tileset** [here](https://www.gameart2d.com/free-graveyard-platformer-tileset.html) (it includes 16 tiles and 14 decorative objects). 

Here is the [TileBased World Tutorial GitHub Repo](https://github.com/RicCastelhano/tilebased-world-tutorial), with proper comments.

Enjoy,
